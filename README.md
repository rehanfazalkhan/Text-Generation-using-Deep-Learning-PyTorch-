# Text-Generation-using-Deep-Learning-PyTorch-
Text Generation is a type of Language Modelling problem. Language Modelling is the core problem for a number of of natural language processing tasks such as speech to text, conversational system, and text summarization. A trained language model learns the likelihood of occurrence of a word based on the previous sequence of words used in the text. Language models can be operated at character level, n-gram level, sentence level or even paragraph level. In this notebook, I will explain how to create a language model for generating natural language text by implement and training state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Network.
